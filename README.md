## CS 363M Principles of ML Final Project

Analysis and modeling of a large airline dataset to predict customer satisfaction and determine factors affecting satisfaction. 

Performed EDA to check for correlations and patterns in predictors, reduced dimensionality of the dataset via feature engineering and PCA. Used DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering to better understand the data. 

Experimented with a number of ML models - linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, naive bayes, neural nets, and random forest - as well as hyperparameter tuning. Also tried under-sampling the majority class and over-sampling the minority class to mitigate class imbalance in the response variable. 

We found that the **random forest** model performed best, with an average accuracy over 90%!
